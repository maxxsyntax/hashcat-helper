#Suggested mask for Hashcat mode 22000 and 22001.
#Regional CPE was distributed with an implied keyspace of 95^12 (540,360,087,662,636,962,890,625 possibilites), but due to an implementation error, 
#can be reduced to 16^2 (256 possibilites) An OUI of the vendor (6 characters) and the last 4 bytes of the BSSID (4 characters) were used as a consistent factors for key generation. 
#This leaves only 2 hex characters to be recovered.
#Replace last four ?H's  with last 4 digits of BSSID, e.g. ARRIS-1234 50A5DC?H?H1234
50A5DC?H?H?H?H?H
